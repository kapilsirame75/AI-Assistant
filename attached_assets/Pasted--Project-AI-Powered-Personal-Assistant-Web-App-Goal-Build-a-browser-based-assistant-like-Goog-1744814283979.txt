🧠 Project: AI-Powered Personal Assistant Web App
🎯 Goal
Build a browser-based assistant (like Google Assistant or Siri) that helps users:

Schedule tasks & reminders

Manage to-do lists

Answer natural language questions

Provide weather/news updates

Automate small routines

Open and search through files/emails (locally or with mock data)

🔧 Tech Stack (All Free & Open Source)

Layer	Tech	Why
Frontend	React.js + Tailwind CSS	Fast UI with modern design
Backend	Python (FastAPI)	Lightweight & async-friendly backend
AI/NLP	Open-source LLMs (like transformers, llama-cpp, gpt4all)	Offline or local model support
Database	SQLite (or PostgreSQL if scaling)	Lightweight, zero-config
Scheduler	Celery + Redis (optional)	For background tasks like reminders
Auth	JWT (JSON Web Token)	Stateless, secure authentication
Deployment	Render / Railway / Fly.io (free tiers)	Free hosting options
🔄 Workflow (Step-by-Step with Feature Explanation)
1. User Interface (React.js)
Clean dashboard with:

Input bar (text-based commands)

Quick buttons (add task, set reminder, ask something)

History of interactions

2. Command Processing Pipeline
Input: “Remind me to submit the project tomorrow at 6 PM”

→ NLP Module (Local LLM or rule-based parsing)

→ Intent Detection (Add Reminder)

→ DateTime Parser (use dateparser, parsedatetime)

→ Save to DB + Trigger background job

3. To-do & Task Management
CRUD APIs:

/tasks/create, /tasks/update, etc.

User tasks stored with status, deadline

Filter by date, completed/pending

4. Reminders & Notifications
Reminders scheduled with Celery (can simulate with JS pop-ups or browser notifications)

Local notification: Use Notification API in browser

Fallback: Just simulate “Reminder Due!” when user logs in

5. AI-Powered Question Answering
Integrate local models (like gpt4all, llama-cpp, or Hugging Face’s bert-base-qa)

Answer general questions, summaries

Option: Let user upload a PDF or paste a text → Ask questions on it

6. News & Weather
Use free APIs like:

https://gnews.io/ (for news, has free tier)

wttr.in (text-based weather)

No registration needed, just fetch JSON

7. Local File Interaction (Optional, Simulated)
Allow user to upload a .txt or .pdf → Parse using PyMuPDF, pdfplumber

Let user ask: “Summarize the uploaded document”

📦 Final Feature Set (Version 1 MVP)

Feature	Description

🔄 Development Plan (30 Days)

Week	Goals
1️⃣	Setup frontend (React UI) + backend (FastAPI) with routing
2️⃣	Build task/reminder system with local notification
3️⃣	Integrate local AI model for Q&A + file upload
4️⃣	Polish UI, add auth, deploy on free hosting
✅ Final Notes
Offline-friendly: You can run this even locally.

Expandable: Later add voice commands (Web Speech API), calendar integrations (Google Calendar).

Free: No paid APIs or hardware needed.

Real-world use case: Students, developers, anyone can use this daily.

Product Potential: Target productivity users, freelancers, developers.
